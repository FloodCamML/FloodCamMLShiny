Highway 12 is the gateway to the North Carolina Outer Banks. It can flood both during storms and high tides. Access 
to NC12 is so important, it even has its own Twitter: @NCDOT_NC12. 

Here, we use public webcam imagery from NC12 to train a machine learning model to identify street flooding. We have
trained the model using 1,200 images, **but it needs to be smarter**. 

Help us train the FloodCamML!
