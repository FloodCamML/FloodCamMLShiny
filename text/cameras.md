Highway 12 is the gateway to the North Carolina Outer Banks. It can flood both during storms and high tides. Access 
to NC12 is so important, it has its own Twitter: [@NCDOT_NC12](https://twitter.com/NCDOT_NC12). 

Here, we use public webcam imagery of NC12 from [DriveNC.gov](https://drivenc.gov) to train a machine learning model -- 
the NC12 FloodCamML -- to identify street flooding. We have
trained the model using 1,200 images, **but you can help make it smarter**. 

Help us train the NC12 FloodCamML!
